## üíª Coding Conventions

This project follows specific coding conventions to maintain a clean and consistent codebase.

### Import Order

Import statements are grouped in the following order, with a blank line between each group for readability.

1.  **External Libraries**: Packages like `react`, `@tanstack/react-router`, etc.
2.  **Internal Absolute Paths**: Imports using the `@/` alias.
3.  **Type Imports**: All `import type {...}` statements.

```tsx
// 1. External Libraries
import { FC } from "react";

// 2. Internal Absolute Paths
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { useAuth } from "@/stores/auth.store";

// 3. Type Imports
import type { Goal } from "@/types/store";
```

### Formatting

- **Biome**: All code is formatted and linted using Biome to ensure consistency.
  - Indentation: 2 spaces
  - Max line length: 120 characters
  - Semicolons: Always used
  - Quotes: Double quotes (`"`)
  - Trailing Commas: Always used (`"all"`)

### Naming Conventions

| Type                | Rule                   | Examples                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Variables, Functions** | `camelCase`            | `totalAmount`, `handleInputChange` |
| **Types**  | `PascalCase`           | `TransactionForm`, `GoalSchema`   |
| **Constants**       | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` | `TRANSACTION_TYPES`, `API_ROUTES` |
| **Files (Component)** | `kebab-case.tsx`       | `transaction-form.tsx`            |
| **Files (Other)**   | `kebab-case.ts`        | `auth.api.ts`, `goal.store.ts`    |
| **Directories**     | `kebab-case`           | `components/ui`, `(private)`      |

### Component Structure

React components are structured in the following order to enhance readability.

1.  **Hooks**: `useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`, custom hooks, etc., at the top.
2.  **State & Derived Variables**: State declarations and variables derived from them.
3.  **Event Handlers**: Functions prefixed with `handle` for event handling.
4.  **`useEffect` Hooks**: Side effect logic.
5.  **Return Statement**: The final JSX to be rendered.

### Handler Functions

- **Passed as Props**: Handlers passed from a parent to a child should be prefixed with `on` (e.g., `onSubmit`, `onDateChange`).
- **Defined Internally**: Handlers defined and used within the same component should be prefixed with `handle` (e.g., `handleFormSubmit`).

### Paths

- **Absolute Paths**: Always use the `@/` alias for imports from the `src` directory to avoid deep relative paths (`../../...`).

### Styling

- **Tailwind CSS**: Styles are applied using Tailwind CSS utility classes, combined with the `cn` utility for conditional classes.
- **Shadcn/ui**: UI components are based on shadcn/ui, with customized versions located in `src/components/ui`.

### API Interaction

- **API Functions**: API calls are defined as functions within the `src/apis` directory.
- **Supabase Client**: All interactions with Supabase are handled through the client instances configured in `src/lib/supabase/client`.
